This is a sweet pain management technique for dealing with happieschizophrenium

I am 26 yo economics grad, unemployed, aiming at series 65, CFA CHARTER HOLDER, full stack web developer, coincidences greater than 95% confidence, friend, homie, bro, brother, son, nephew, self, sanity, financial markets, classical musical, sharp ratios, fine lines || complete-fucki get-insanity.

Losing my mind. 

Changes logged and documented elsewhere. Changes for the good, mostly for the better and the feeling of pure honesty and love is incredible! Basically!
